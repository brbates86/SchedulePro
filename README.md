# Work-Day-Schedule
A work day schedule to help with staying on task.

For this weeks challenge we were given the task of creating a weekly work day schedule that helps the user stay on track during a busy work week. There were some cool things I learned this week. When the scheduler is pulled up the user sees the day of the week the month of the year and also the current time of day. they will also see which time block has past, which time block is the present and which time blocks are to come. I used moment.js, bootstrap and jquery which are all linked in the index.html. I also added a little style with css. heres the link to check it out for yourself!  https://brbates86.github.io/Work-Day-Schedule/
